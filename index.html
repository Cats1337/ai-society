        <h1>AI, Age, and the Illusion of Safety</h1>
        <p>
          The UK Online Safety Act gives Ofcom power to demand “proportionate” age checks.
          Platforms lean on AI tools like face estimation, document scans, and behavior modeling to avoid full ID uploads.
          In the process they build an infrastructure for routine identity checks online.

          <p>
            Law that obliges services to reduce exposure to illegal and high risk content.
            Ofcom can fine and block access. Age assurance sits at the center for “primary priority” content.

          The Act is framed as a duty of care.
          Ofcom can require platforms to stop minors from reaching “primary priority content”.
          Age checks must be proportionate, but vendors are selling AI shortcuts that come with their own risks.

          <p>
            Sites must show that they take appropriate measures to keep minors out of restricted areas.
            Enforcement can escalate to fines and access blocking if they cannot demonstrate this.

        <h2>How AI based age detection works</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          Systems blend multiple signals.
          Each signal trades convenience against accuracy, privacy, and fairness.
          Together they create a gate that can feel simple for users but complex behind the scenes.

          <h3>Facial analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Neural networks predict age from selfies or live video.
            Performance drops for darker skin tones, trans users, and teens near 18.
            Lighting and camera quality matter in ways that rarely show up in glossy demos.

          <h3>Document verification</h3>
          <p>
            OCR reads passports or IDs, face match compares an ID photo to a live selfie,
            and liveness checks try to resist replays. Sensitive data flows through even when vendors say “verification only”.

          <div class="pill">Behavioral</div>
          <h3>Pattern analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Models infer age from typing cadence, scroll speed, payment history, or playtime.
            This logic is opaque and risks false blocks for neurodivergent users or anyone with unusual usage patterns.

            SIM checks, carrier age flags, device fingerprints, and account histories.
            Cross platform tracking risk grows as these signals are combined into unified profiles.
